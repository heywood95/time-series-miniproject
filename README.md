# Time Series Mini-Project
 
# Project Description
 
The average temperatures for Acre, Brazil will be investigated using average temperatures from 1980-2013 to predict future average temperatures using time series techniques, and make predictions on temperatures in the region. 
 
# Project Goal
 
* Construct an ML Time Series model that analyzes the patterns in temperature over time.
* The model will then forecast temperature into the future.
* Deliver a report that explains what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.
* Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in predicting temperature.
